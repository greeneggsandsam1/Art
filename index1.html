<p> Never give up on yourself, never. Not before youre an addict, not while becoming an addict, not after you're a recovered addcit. 
  Never give up on youself because that can become way more toxic than any susbatance could ever be. 
  Every life is fighting for, even yours. I promise, the day you die, people you dont even know will mourn your death. 
  Drugs don't define you, but your decisons do.
